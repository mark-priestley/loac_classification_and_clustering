# Year 2. Classification and clustering of loan applicants

This repo contains jupyter notebooks and pdf submissions for assignments in my year 2 module "Data Warehousing and OLAP".

The assignments involved classifying and clustering loan applicants (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset). I used KNN and Decision Trees for classification and I used K means Clustering and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering to cluster the applicants.

The pdf files gives detail about data cleaning and data exploration, explanations behind the algorithms and how I implemented them
